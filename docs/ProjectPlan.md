# Project Plan

## Summary
This site is for Verde Cars, a car rental business. All users must have an account with the site in order to access it. There are four different kinds of users this site supports: customers, customer service employees, automobile retrieval specialist employees, and admins. The site is meant to help users easily rent cars from VerdeCars, keep track of employee hours and wages, and enable the admin to pay the employees, as well as keep track of other logistics for the company.  

## Team Organization
There are four people on our team: Blaine, Daniel, Sarah, and Ann Marie. Each member of the team will take an even share of the workload. For the first sprint, our scrum master is Ann Marie.  

## Software Development Process
To efficiently organize the work we need to do on this project, our process will be broken into 4 development phases; project planning and requirements gathering, system analysis & design, implementation and unit testing, and deployment. Each of these phases will be accomplished in a two week sprint, with the exception of phase three which will be broken into three two-week sprints.  We will use burndown charts for each sprint to keep track of how much work we have left to do vs time left in any given sprint.  

Each phase will also reflect a spiral development process, in that each phase will include elements of the other phases; for example, phase 3 in which we implement our code may still include some requirements gathering, analysis, and design. This will especially help if we find that we need to make adjustments and changes in the functionality or design of the program.  

## Policies, procedures, and tools for communication
###Policies
Be clear and concise with timelines and due date
Be responsible as a team member and protect ‘customer’ data
When making a pull request one other person must accept the request before merging the current branch
Follow listed procedures  
###Procedures
When assigning a new task make sure that it fits the current sprint and priority
When creating a new branch make sure you are branching from the correct location i.e., 
When branching from master create a sprint branch(Sprint-”sprint-number”
When branching from a sprint create a feature branch (feature/”feature-name”)
If there is a bug that can be fixed in a couple of seconds you can create a branch from master called (bugfix/”bugfix-name”)
When merging a branch into another branch each developer must submit a pull request that can be accepted after another developer reviews the pull request.  
###Tools For Communication  
Discord will be the primary means of communication for the project with the occasional email if needs be
We will be using Git and Jira for task management and version control 

## Risk Analysis
As a website that handles financial transactions, there are inevitably multiple risks involved, ranging from motivated attacks to clerical errors which can result in significant losses of revenue.  
Additionally, the high level permissions of admins must be strictly protected as a breach of security could cause massive damages.
Customers acting in bad faith could potentially disrupt services for other customers (Making and canceling car reservations), however, through effort this can be mitigated.
The website deals with valuable physical goods (cars). These must be regularly screened for undisclosed damages and undergo regular maintenance.
