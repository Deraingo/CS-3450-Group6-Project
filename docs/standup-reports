3.7.23 --------------------------------------

Ann Marie
1. I finally got the login working! wooooo hooo! I've also worked a little bit on the retrievalList page (which displays to the retrieval specialist the cars that have broken down) and gotten it to load things from the database.
I also updated the database kind of a lot. I realized that the car database model didn't store the car's make or model, or address, or year, so I added all that in
I also defined str for both database models so that they'll appear more readably on the admin page
And I updated the user class to have a phone number field
2. What I want to do before next scrum: link retrievalList and retrievalPage so that clicking on a car will take you to a new page with that car's info on it, and adding buttons to update the database when a car has been retrieved
3. other homework, going home for the break (woo hoo ðŸ™‚)

(whoops it looks like I never got this written down vvv)

to discuss: plan for assigning all cars to admin from the outset?
Notes: we just want something that works


Daniel:

3. other homework

Ann Marie:
1. noticed problem of linking car and user together (resolved now, yay :)

3. geo field trip to canyonlands and price

Sarah:
1. tried to figure out the checking out / reserving car page; getting info in there, how to do that; working on admin page -> displays the users, once we have a way for employees to have hours in the database admin should be able to pay them from that page
